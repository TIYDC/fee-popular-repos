# GitHub Repos

A small app to display github repos for practice at The Iron Yard.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, then run an http server in the `src/` directory. Be sure to type in your GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to authenticate with GitHub.
  NOTE: you must have a GitHub account to get a personal access token.

  ## About
  Entering your token and the username of the user whose repositories you wish to review, you will be presented with a list of panels. Clickiing on the panel will reveal additional repository information.

  This project uses Angular directives/filters, and Bootstrap for simple styling. It's purpose is to be versatile enough to easily use in other contexts.
